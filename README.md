# checkMblFriendlyUrl
Small PHP code to test if a url is mobile friendly using the Google Test Mobile-Friendly API

You need to pass two parameters in the URL:

	url 	-> the url you want to check
	apiKey 	-> provided by Google to work with the API

An example:
http://yoururl/check_mbl_friendly.php?url=http://theurltocheck.com&apiKey=yourgoogleapikey

You will recieve a json object with the Google response.
